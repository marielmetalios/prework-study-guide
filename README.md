Bootcamp Prework Study Guide for Students
# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- I built this project to learn the initial and fundamental steps of building a webpage. I'm starting a coding bootcamp and this will function as a study guide for the course. For this initial project, we built a site structure using HTML, styled the page with CSS, and made it dynamic with Javacscript. Throughout the project, we used GitBash (desktop version) and GitHub (online) to push both local and web changes. 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This is a simple study guide, but if you Inspect the page and open the the DevTools console, you can see the JavaScript running. It  lists topics learned in our prework. 

## Credits

There were no GitHub collaborators, but I did use EdEx's Xpert Learning Assistant to troubleshoot issues with my code.
